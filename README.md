# MultiplicationTable

1.	Develop a web page that will plot to the screen the multiplication table up to 10X10. 
2. Add a tooltip to each cell, to show the exercise that it is the result of (i.e. 32 will show 8X4=32 in the tool tip) 
3. Add a URL parameter matrix_size (or GUI control) that selects the value (default =10) between 3 to 15 and refresh the page to show the relevant table. 
4. Add a URL parameter matrix_base (or GUI control) which has three options (decimal, binary, hex), so the user can decide in which format he will see the table. Once selected the table is refreshed with the relevant values. 
5. (Optional) – color the background of the Prime numbers. 


Programming environment: please use only one of the following technologies: ASP.NET forms, .NET MVC, AngularJS or JQuery.
 
The result should be: 

1. If possible, hosted on some site.
2. In any case, please send the code to us. 

Internally we would use Azure Cloud – so if possible use this platform to host your solution. 

Hint: Invest some time on the UI; user experience is important for us!

Good Luck!

Thank You
